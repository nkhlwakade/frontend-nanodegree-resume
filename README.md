# Project Details
This project is regarding creation of a resume in the form of website using javascript to make it more interactive.

## How do I complete this project?
Review the Online Resume [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.189245867.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2962818615/rubric).

1. In this project I have store your resume data in four javaScript objects according to the schema given below. As is often the case when leveraging an API, the objects follow the schema exactly.
2. After the creation of javaScript objects, write the code needed to display all of the resume data contained within these objects in the resume.
3. All of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in **js/helper.js** variables. The variable names indicate their function.
4. You will get the [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) here, and include it as the value of the `key` parameter when loading the Google Maps API in **index.html**:
